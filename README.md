My goal for this project was to create a fully functional MERN stack app in 7 days.


## Inspiration

Working in the property management industry, I gained an insight into how landlords and tenants effectively communicated with one another. I noticed a lack of effective communication between both parties which resulted in an unfavourable strain on the relationship. Basic communication about outstanding bills, maintenance and complaints were not effectively communicated. PropManage aim is to reinvigorate that bond and change the stigma of unreliable landlords and tricky tenants.

## Technologies

I employed the following technologies to make my MERN stack app:

* HTML5
* SCSS
* JavaScript
* React
* Bulma
* Insomnia
* Google Maps
* Google Fonts
* Atom

## Challenges and Problems

* One of the biggest issues I had when first starting my project was the login system. I wanted be able to differentiate landlords and tenants on sign up.

* Updating user credentials in the Navbar after login proved tricky. This is because the state would not be updated after a user had logged in. Only a hard refresh would rectify this.

## Wins

* The app is functional!

* It was a big achievement being bale to differentiate between the type of user logging in. This allowed me to further develop each user types profile to display information only relevant to them.

## Future Features

* Messaging system, where landlords and tenants can securely message each other.

* Implement a card payment system using a 3rd party API. This is so tenants are able to pay any upcoming bills directly to the landlord.

* Notification system where tenants would be notified via email or phone regarding any maintenance or repairs happening in the house.

* Include filesatck so users (both landlord and tenant) can update their profiles using images on their machines.

* Having an OAuth feature that allows both types of users to quickly sign up would be a a major benefit.

* A better designed webpage to enhance the user experience.
