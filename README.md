My goal for this project was to create a fully functional MERN stack app in 7 days.


##Inspiration

Working in the property management industry, I gained an insight into how landlords and tenants effectively communicated with one another. I noticed a lack of effective communication between both parties which resulted in an unfavourable strain on the relationship. Basic communication about outstanding bills, maintenance and complaints were not effectively communicated. PropManage aim is to reinvigorate that bond and change the stigma of unreliable landlords and tricky tenants.
