My goal for this project was to create a fully functional MERN stack app in 7 days.


## Inspiration

Working in the property management industry, I gained an insight into how landlords and tenants effectively communicated with one another. I noticed a lack of effective communication between both parties which resulted in an unfavourable strain on the relationship. Basic communication about outstanding bills, maintenance and complaints were not effectively communicated. PropManage aim is to reinvigorate that bond and change the stigma of unreliable landlords and tricky tenants.

## Technologies

I employed the following technologies to make my MERN stack app:

### Languages:
* HTML5
* SCSS
* JavaScript

### Front-end Web Application Framework:
* React

### CSS Framework:
* Bulma

### REST client:
* Insomnia

### APIs:
* Google Maps

### Typefaces:
* Google Fonts
* Atom

## Challenges and Problems

* One of the biggest issues I had when first starting my project was the login system. I wanted be able to differentiate landlords and tenants on sign up.

## Wins

* The app is functional!

*

## Future Features

* Messaging system, where landlords and tenants can securely message eachother.

* Implement a card payment system using a 3rd party API. This is so tenants are able to pay any upcoming bills dierectly to the landlord.

* Notification system where tenants would be notified via email or phone reagrding any maintenance or repairs happening in the house.
